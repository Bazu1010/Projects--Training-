        Psilocybin is a hallucinogenic chemical in certain mushrooms known as magic mushrooms. Eating mushrooms that
        contain psilocybin can have a variety of effects, ranging from euphoria to hallucinations.
        <br>
        Individuals use psilocybin as a recreational drug. It can provide feelings of euphoria and sensory distortion
        that are common to hallucinogenic drugs, such as LSD.
    </p>
    <p>
        Possible effects of psilocybin include:
    <ul>
        <li>Euphoria</li>
        <li>Peacefulness</li>
        <li>Derealization, or the feeling that surroundings are not real</li>
        <li>Visual alteration and distortion, such as seeing halos of light and vivid colors</li>
        <li>Distorted thinking</li>

    </ul>
    <p>
        All orders come in capsule form or packaged as whole.
